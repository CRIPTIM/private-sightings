Private Reporting of Sightings
==============================
To run the code you need to install [Charm](http://charm-crypto.com/) and its dependencies.

The scheme by [Shi et al.](http://www.internetsociety.org/doc/privacy-preserving-aggregation-time-series-data-paper) is implemented in the file `private_sightings/scrcs11.py`.
An example of the package's usage is provided in `example.py`.
